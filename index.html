        The ENIAC project highlights how computing work was originally seen as
        clerical and thus assigned to women. As computing gained more
        prestige, these roles were reclassified as male-dominated professions,
        pushing the groundbreaking contributions of women, like the ENIAC
        programmers, into the background. This shift in how tech work was
        defined has had a long-lasting effect on how we perceive the history
        of computing and the role of women in technology.

        <h2>Meet ELIZA 2.0!</h2>
        <p>
          In Your Computer is On Fire, Mar Hicks discusses how ELIZA, though a
          simple chatbot and not a real person, was often sexualized and
          subjected to gender stereotypes by users. ELIZA, designed as a digital
          psychotherapist, became a vessel for users to project their desires
          and behaviors, including sexual objectification. Despite its lack of
          gender or identity, users treated it as a “female” presence,
          reinforcing societal biases and stereotypes around women, particularly
          in tech spaces. This shows how even non-human, gendered systems can be
          objectified and mistreated in ways that reflect broader social
          dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          This directly ties into the theme of how gender dynamics have shaped
          the development of computing. Just as women in early computing, such
          as Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper, often faced marginalization or had
          their contributions minimized, systems like ELIZA, which users viewed
          through a gendered lens, became subject to similar treatment. It
          reveals how technology, even when it is gender-neutral, can still be
          shaped and influenced by societal gender norms and biases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by ELIZA, I wanted to create a simple version of the chatbot
          with an added feature to counteract these issues: if the bot detects
          inappropriate language, like the word “ugly,” it automatically ends
          the conversation. This serves as a way to prevent the chatbot from
          being subjected to rude or harmful behavior, something ELIZA couldn’t
          do. By enforcing boundaries for respectful interaction, this chatbot
          reflects an effort to challenge the objectification and mistreatment
          that often occur with gendered systems, encouraging users to engage
          more thoughtfully. In this way, the project not only highlights how
          gender dynamics have influenced human interactions with computing
          systems but also explores how we can programmatically resist and
          reshape those dynamics moving forward.

      <h1>A Queer History of Computing</h1>

      <div id="intro-section" class="story-section">
        <p>
          It's the early 1950s, and you are a mathematician at a time when the world of computing is just beginning to take shape. You are surrounded by pioneering figures—Alan Turing, Christopher Strachey, and others—who are laying the foundations for modern technology. However, this is also a time when societal norms, especially around gender and sexuality, are restrictive and discriminatory. You are faced with difficult choices: do you conform to these norms to survive, or do you push the boundaries in both your personal life and your work in computing?
        </p>
        <button class="choice-button" onclick="chooseOption('conform')">Conform to societal norms</button>
        <button class="choice-button" onclick="chooseOption('push')">Push the boundaries</button>
      </div>

      <div id="conform-section" class="story-section hidden">
        <p>
          You choose to conform. Your work is focused purely on the technical aspects of computing, and though you excel in your field, you keep your personal life hidden. Like many queer figures in computing history, your contributions are recognized, but your identity is erased. You later realize that, by hiding your true self, you have contributed to a version of computing history that omits the diversity of voices that shaped it. Do you continue to stay silent, or do you decide to reclaim your identity?
        </p>
        <button class="choice-button" onclick="chooseOption('staySilent')">Stay silent</button>

      </div>

      <div id="push-section" class="story-section hidden">
        <p>
          You choose to push the boundaries. Much like Christopher Strachey, who created the first love letter generator in the early 1950s, you see computing as a space for creative expression. Your work blurs the line between art and science, and your personal identity influences the experimental nature of your projects. However, society is not ready for this. Your colleagues dismiss your work, and your personal life becomes a subject of scrutiny. Do you continue your experimental work despite the criticism, or do you shift towards more conventional computing projects?
        </p>
        <button class="choice-button" onclick="chooseOption('continueExperiment')">Continue experimenting</button>
        <button class="choice-button" onclick="chooseOption('shift')">Shift to conventional computing</button>

      <div id="staySilent-section" class="story-section hidden">
        <p>
          You choose to stay silent. Though you are successful in your career, the erasure of your identity weighs heavily on you. You see how the history of computing develops without acknowledging the contributions of queer figures like Alan Turing, and you regret not speaking out. As computing becomes more influential, you wonder: could things have been different if you had pushed back against societal norms? Your legacy, though respected, is incomplete.

      </div>
      <div id="reclaim-section" class="story-section hidden">
        <p>
          You choose to reclaim your identity. Inspired by the courage of figures like Alan Turing, you decide that your personal story deserves to be part of computing history. You openly express your identity and challenge the norms of the time. Though it is difficult, and there are personal and professional costs, your story becomes part of the growing narrative that queer figures played a pivotal role in the development of computing. You have helped to reshape the narrative of computing, ensuring that it reflects the diversity of its contributors.

        <button class="choice-button" onclick="restartStory()">Restart Story</button>
      </div>
      <div id="continueExperiment-section" class="story-section hidden">
        <p>
          You choose to continue your experimental work. Like Strachey’s love letter generator, your projects are ahead of their time and challenge conventional ideas about what computing can be. Your work gains recognition in creative circles, but it is dismissed by the mainstream computing community. However, you find a community of like-minded thinkers who see the potential in your blend of art and computing, and over time, your contributions are recognized as foundational to computational art. 
        </p>
        <button class="choice-button" onclick="restartStory()">Restart Story</button>

      <div id="shift-section" class="story-section hidden">
        <p>
          You choose to shift towards more conventional computing projects. Your work gains widespread recognition, and you make significant contributions to programming and mathematics. However, your earlier creative projects—those that were influenced by your identity—are forgotten. Though you are celebrated in the computing world, you feel as though a part of your story has been lost, much like how Christopher Strachey's contributions to both art and science were overshadowed by his technical achievements.
